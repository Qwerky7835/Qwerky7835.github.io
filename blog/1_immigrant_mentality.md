# Immigrant mentality
In February this year, I quit my job, caught covid and followed my boyfriend to his home country to see if I can settle there all in the space of 2 weeks. Needless to say, my mental health took a dive, I came back to the country where I have a residence permit for, also not my home country, and thought a lot about what it means to be an immigrant and the challenges in identity, mental health and sense of belonging that comes to those of us that are veterans in running our lives out of two suitcases.

### Who am I?
I am a Chinese South African. In the simple sense. I was born in China and raised in South Africa. It's how I introduce myself to others which allows all parties to establish an initial common connection to refer back to for deeper talks in the future. I think it is high time that we break free from geographically defined identities.

### Community, roots, the immigrant identity
